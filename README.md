Steering system:

Making steering system from scratch. To make it get a 7 inch long 1 inch thick flatbar and bend it to make a C shape, of 2 inch, 3 inch and 2 inch

Iam going to drill a hole through the 2 inch parts and put a big bolt in those.Before you put the bolt put a 1 inch steel pipe which is 3 inches long.

Then weld a rod and a square pipe at 90 degrees.On the square pipe, weld a bolt facing upwards.Then after that,put a tie rod end on the welded bolt.Next,weld a steel rod to the tie rod end.

The 48V LiFePO4 battery drives the controller, which receives input from the accelerate pedal and puts the correct amount of power to the 1000W BLDC motor to regulate the gokarts speed.
